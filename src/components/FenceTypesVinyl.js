This fence style offers a seamless look since the overlapping boards cover any gaps that might widen over time due to weather or shifting. It's a popular choice for those seeking both privacy and a visually appealing boundary. The construction of a board on board fence also provides good wind resistance due to the alternating board pattern." },

This design contrasts with the traditional vertical fence style, offering a sleek and contemporary look. Horizontal fences are known for their clean lines and can make a space appear larger and more open. They are versatile in design, allowing for various board spacing and sizes, which can be customized to achieve different levels of privacy and aesthetic appeal. This type of fence is particularly popular in modern home landscaping and urban design." },
